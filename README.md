# Roadsign_Detection_YOLO_Indian_Roads
YOLO implementation for realtime object detection and classification of roadsigns.

This is a darknet implementation of YOLO to detect and classify roadsigns with a good confidance score.

Currently the model is able to classify and detect one of the following 3 road-signs:
1) Speed Limit
2) Left Turn
3) Right Turn

The  model was trained on a basic 13" Macbook Pro machine without any GPU support.
The results can be found in the YOLO_Predictions.zip directory.

We can immensely improve the model performance by training the model on a GPU and adding a more classes of roadsigns.
